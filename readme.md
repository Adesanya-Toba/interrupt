## Running locally

### Installing Dependencies

Install the [Ruby version that is listed for GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/versions/).
If you're using `rbenv`, it should have picked the correct version from `.ruby-version` already.

Install dependencies using `bundler` (install via `gem install bundler` if necessary) via

```
bundle install
```

### Running the Server

To serve locally, you'll want to change the baseurl. You'll likely also want to
see your drafts.

We recommend:

```terminal
$ bundle install jekyll serve -b / -D
```
